# 🤖 Agentic RAG Document Search System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** built with a **Streamlit UI** that allows users to ask questions over a set of documents (fetched from URLs).

It processes documents, converts them into embeddings, stores them in a vector database, and uses an LLM-powered agent to retrieve and generate accurate answers.

## 🔄 Basic Flow of the Project

1. **Application Startup**
   - The Streamlit app (`streamlit_app.py`) initializes the UI.
   - Session state is prepared to store system state and history.

2. **System Initialization**
   - LLM is loaded using configuration settings.
   - Documents are fetched from predefined URLs.
   - Documents are split into chunks.

3. **Data Processing**
   - Processed documents are embedded.
   - Embeddings are stored in a vector database.

4. **Graph Construction (Agentic RAG)**
   - A graph-based pipeline is built using:
     - Retriever (Vector Store)
     - LLM
   - This enables intelligent query handling.

5. **User Query Flow**
   - User enters a question in the UI.
   - Query is passed to the RAG system.
   - Relevant documents are retrieved.
   - LLM generates a final answer.

6. **Response Display**
   - Answer is shown in the UI.
   - Source documents are displayed.
   - Query history is maintained.

## 🚀 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

1. Load documents from the internet  
2. Break them into small chunks  
3. Convert chunks into embeddings  
4. Store embeddings in a vector database  
5. When user asks a question:
   - Find similar chunks
   - Send them to the LLM
   - Generate a precise answer
